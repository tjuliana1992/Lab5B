# Lab5B
The answer that should be provided by your program should be the smallest
number that equally divides by the number entered in. For example, 200 in sample output #2
is both divisible by 2 and by 5, however, your program should prioritize printing out it is
divisible by 2 rather than it being divisible by 5. Only numbers that are strictly divisible only
by 5 should print “This number is divisible by 5” for example like 25.
